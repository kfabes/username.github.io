 <h3>I'm just doing my best to see how things work and give this all a try!</h3>
  <p>Welcome to my website!
 I'm trying out some new things on this site, including:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>writing code by myself</li>
  <li>learning how things work</li>
  <li>making lots of mistakes so I can practice problem solving</li>
